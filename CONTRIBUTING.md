## Commit Messages

Zink is using gitmoji. You can use [`gitmoji-cli`](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli) when create commit. If you want to type commit manually, you can follow the below steps:

- Select commit type (see: https://gitmoji.dev/)
- Type the scopes (if your commit is global, it's not scope needed) Scopes: `rt|api|client|`
- Types your commit description

Your commit structure must looks like:
```
:gitmoji:(scope): description 
```
